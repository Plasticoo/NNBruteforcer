NNBruteforcer
=============

ATTENTION
=========

This is just a project I made for learning experience. I'm not responsible for whatever you do with  
this software.


What is it?
-----------

This is a simple single-threaded bruteforcer I made for learning purposes  
with a plugin system.  
Originally made in **Python 3.4**.


Why?
----

Nothing in particular. I thought it would be fun trying to create one.
